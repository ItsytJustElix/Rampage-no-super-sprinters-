# About
I been learning how plutonium codes things, so I made Rampage Inducer type exept it DOES NOT change the zombies speed. This mod was specificly mod for how zombies spawn so they dont take forever to spawn.
# How Mod Works
If any player would of holded knife for about 3-4 seconds it would turn it on, and if any player would of holded there crouch button for a solid 3-4 seconds it would turn it off.
# How To Use Mod
To apply the mod to your game hold the windows key and R, this will open a application called "Run" Put in %localappdata%\Plutonium\storage\t6\scripts\zm inside the open bar it should load up your mods folder. Finaly, all you have to do now is move that gsc file to the folder.
# Difference Between V1 and V2
V2 is almost the exact same thing as V1, but V2 has a little hud on the top of the screen that tells you if you activated it.
